/**
 * The <code>MinuetoMouseHanlder</code> is an interface for receiving a mouse event 
 * (motion, click) from a <code>MinuetoWindow</code> and handling it.
 * <p>
 * In other words, the class that will handle mouse input from <code>MinuetoWindow</code> must extend
 * this interface. In turn, that class must be registered with
 * the <code>MinuetoEventQueue</code>.
 * <p>
 * An event is generated everytime the mouse is clicked or moved. 
 * When the handle method on the <code>MinuetoEventQueue</code> is invoked, that
 * event is processed and the appropriate method in <code>MinuetoMouseHandler</code>
 * is invoked.
