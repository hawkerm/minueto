/**
 * The <code>MinuetoMouseWheelHandler</code> is an interface for receiving a mouse wheel event 
 * (rotate) from a <code>MinuetoWindow</code> and handling it.
 * <p>
 * In other words, the class that will handle mouse wheel input from <code>MinuetoWindow</code> 
 * must extend this interface. In turn, that class must be registered with
 * the <code>MinuetoEventQueue</code>.
 * <p>
 * An event is generated everytime the mouse wheel is turned. 
 * When the handle method on the <code>MinuetoEventQueue</code> is invoked, that
 * event is processed and the appropriate method in <code>MinuetoMouseWheelHandler</code>
 * is invoked.
